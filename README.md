## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cv/ -> https://github.com/sanman1k98/cv.git
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ info/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ work.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
